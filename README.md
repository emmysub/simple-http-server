simple-http-server
==================
This is simple but functional http server with the following features:

1. start with chosen port `shs --port 8080` (defaults to 8000)
2. show directory listing
3. show `404` if appropriate
4. send files with guessed content-type

It was written as `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer` replacement and to play with
coffescript.
